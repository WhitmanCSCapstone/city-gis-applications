							<p>Colleagues congratulated him on his long and storied career and presented him with a&nbsp;book of remembrances. A tribute video by film and media studies major Tywin Kelly '18 captured additional fond sentiments, as did a performance of Tim McGraw's 2015 hit single "Humble and Kind" by residence life staff. <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/newsroom/chuck-cleveland-retirement">Read more.&nbsp;</a></p>
