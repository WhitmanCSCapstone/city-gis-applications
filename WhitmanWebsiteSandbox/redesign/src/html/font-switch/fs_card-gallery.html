What does it mean for politics and policymaking that Social Security recipients are widely viewed as deserving of the benefits they receive? In the 2005 privatization debates, Congress framed Social Security in exclusively positive terms, often in opposition to welfare, and imagined their own beloved family members as recipients. Advocates for private accounts sought to navigate the politics of deservingness by dividing the \"we\" of social insurance to a \"me\" of private investment and a \"them\" of individual rate of return in order to justify the introduction of private accounts into Social Security. Fiscal stress on the program will likely bring Social Security to the policy agenda soon.

In performing a rhetorical cartography that explores the rise of the U.S. armed drone program as well as moments of resistive violence that occurred during the Arab Spring directed at generating a counter-hegemony by Muslim populations, Hayes argues that the problem of the global terror wars is best addressed by a rhetorical understanding of the ways that governments, as well as individual subjects, turn to violence as a response to, or product of, the post-September 11 terror society. When political examinations of terrorism are facilitated through understandings of discourse, clearer maps emerge of how violence functions to offer mechanisms by which governing bodies, and their subjects, evaluate the success or failure of the \"War on Terror.\"\u003c/p\u003e"},{"xid":"x40357","title":"Because You Asked","subtitle":"A Book of Answers on the Art and Craft of the Writing Life","author":"Katrina Roberts","image":"https://www.whitman.edu/assets/images/Academics/English/HomePageSlides/because-you-asked.jpg","imageAltText":"Because You Asked Book Cover","bodyCopy":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/academics/departments-and-programs/english/english-faculty/katrina-c-roberts\" \u003eKatrina Roberts\u003c/a\u003e,\u0026nbsp;Mina Schwabacher Professor of English/Creative Writing and Humanities\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/ROBBEC.html\"\u003eUniversity of Washington Press\u003c/a\u003e, 2015\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBecause You Asked\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;draws from over 15 years of curating the Visiting Writers Reading Series at Whitman College.
