					<p>Throughout the summer, I interned at and explored the daily running of the Thompson Family Acupuncture Clinic in Walla Walla. There, I was able to expose myself to the full range of an acupuncture clinic's operations, researching and making herbal formulas, designing brochures and introducing Traditional Chinese Medicine to patients, assisting the clinic in the process of buying another business and running cash flow analysis, dealing with insurance companies and basic reception work, performing moxa on patients, and changing linens for treatment rooms. This internship also gave me an opportunity to understand how Chinese medical services translate into an American context. I also worked at the Saturday farmer's market to introduce acupuncture and other traditional Chinese therapies to a wider community, attracting people to give acupuncture a try. There, I was able not only to feel the pulses of patients, but also to feel the pulse of Walla Walla's trend towards seeking alternative medicine.</p>

					<p>The UCCE Ventura County office provides and distributes solutions backed by research to help sustain farms and nurseries and to create educational programs for home gardeners, and youth development organizations like 4-H. This summer I have been doing a variety of experimental trials on the two spot spider mite pest that threaten crops grown in Ventura County. We are testing the effects of residual toxicity of pesticides on beneficial predatory mites in an effort to control these pests on strawberry plants. Farmers must rely on biological agents for pest management when they have exhausted their allowed pesticide usages. Our results will be shared with growers to help them manage the pests in an environmentally and sustainable way.</p>

I have gotten the opportunity to work with their Community Relations officer as well as their publications and Media-Monitoring officers. As of now, I have been placed in the Akosombo location, where the second largest man-made lake, the Volta, and the biggest dam in Ghana are located. As a result, I interact with a lot of tourists that come to visit the dam. I also get to interact with people from the communities that were impacted by the building of the dam. It has been really interesting getting to see how such a big corporation created by the government is progressing despite the hardship of being a third world country. This is a picture of me visiting one of the Volta River Authority farms created and located in the impacted communities.</p>

By analyzing the death rates of cancerous and normal cells treated with saponins as well as the genes being expressed at the time of death, I hope to be able to prove that saponins selectively kill cancerous cells, most of which can be done using techniques taught within Whitman's own laboratory courses!</p>

As part of this lab, I am working with two species of salamanders (the adorable Batrachoseps luciae and equally adorable Aneides lugubris) to study the effects of Bd infection on their health and to determine if their symbiotic skin bacteria have Bd-inhibitory properties which may help the salamanders to better cope with the fungal parasite.</p>

Aisha Fukushima obtained a Watson Fellowship to travel the world and collaborate with international Hip-Hop artists to help create social awareness and social justice on a more global scale. Her RAPtivism project took her to connecting with Hip-Hop artists and activists from France, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Japan, Germany, England, South Africa, Senegal, India, Denmark, Capetown, and beyond. She also interviewed these artists and activists, and that's where I come in. I am working on creating short documentary type clips of these interviews that she will then send out through social media to let their voices be heard. The interviews focus on their opinions and ways in which to create social awareness and social justice within their own community and how Hip-Hop has the ability to achieve that goal. I also help Aisha (as she is a singer/emcee) manage her schedule and her promotion for upcoming shows, workshops, and performances, occasionally helping out at the events themselves.</p>

At Liberty Tree Foundation I am conducting public policy research in the following areas: community sovereignty, participatory democracy, environmental policy and electoral reforms including publicly financed elections, instant runoff voting and proportional representation. With the Global Climate Convergence, I helped with community outreach to promote what’s expected to be the largest climate justice demonstration in history, which is taking place in NYC this upcoming September 19th-21st of 2014. My work with the Federation of United Tribes has involved advocacy and community outreach to support the unification of all Native American Tribes and to promote the recognition and protection of Native American Treaty Rights, which will help to protect their ancestral lands and environmental sustainability for future generations. The Federation of United Tribes is working in solidarity with other related indigenous movements such as the Idle No More movement. In summary, my primary focus this summer has been to build bridges of dialogue, solidarity, cooperation and collaboration between these various organizations, since they all work to protect the environment, address climate change and promote human rights.</p>
